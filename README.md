# Bitwise Operators

### 1\. **Bitwise AND (&)**:

The bitwise AND operator compares corresponding bits of two integers. The result is `1` if both bits are `1`; otherwise, it is `0`.

### 2\. **Bitwise OR (|)**:

The bitwise OR operator compares corresponding bits of two integers. The result is `1` if at least one of the bits is `1`; otherwise, it is `0`.

### 3\. **Bitwise XOR (^)**:

The bitwise XOR operator compares corresponding bits of two integers. The result is `1` if the bits are different (i.e., one is `1` and the other is `0`); otherwise, it is `0`.

### 4\. **Bitwise NOT (~)**:

The bitwise NOT operator inverts all the bits of a number, changing `1` to `0` and `0` to `1`. It’s also called the **one’s complement** operator.

### 5\. **Bitwise Left Shift (<<)**:

The left shift operator shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions. It is equivalent to multiplying the number by `2` for each shift.

### 6\. **Bitwise Right Shift (>>)**:

The right shift operator shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions. It is equivalent to dividing the number by `2` for each shift.
